In most programming languages, what is the syntax for a FOR loop?
a) for (initialize; condition; update),
b) while (condition){},
c) if (condition) { },
d) repeat (condition) {}, A
How does the FOR loop differ from a WHILE loop?
a) The FOR loop is used for indefinite iteration while the WHILE loop is used for definite iteration,
b) The FOR loop is used for definite iteration while the WHILE loop is used for indefinite iteration,
c) There is no difference; FOR and WHILE loops are interchangeable,
d) The FOR loop is only used in specific programming languages while the WHILE loop is universal, B
What is the purpose of the CONTINUE statement within a FOR loop?
a) To terminate the loop prematurely,
b) To skip the rest of the code in the loop and move to the next iteration,
c) To exit the entire program, 
d) To restart the loop from the beginning, B
In a FOR loop, what is the role of the iteration variable?
a) It represents the number of iterations completed,
b) It holds the final result of the loop,
c) It controls the loop's termination condition, 
d) It takes on different values during each iteration, D
What is the purpose of the RANGE function commonly used with FOR loops in Python?
a) To generate a sequence of numbers that the loop iterates over, 
b) To specify the range of memory used by the loop ,
c) To define the data type of the loop variable ,
d) To determine the maximum number of iterations for the loop, A
How can you create an infinite loop using a FOR loop?
a) Use a negative increment in the update expression, 
b) Omit the update expression,
c) Set the condition to always be true, 
d) Use a BREAK statement inside the loop, C
In a FOR loop, if you want to iterate over elements in an array, what should be used as the iteration variable?

b) The length of the array,  
c) The index of the array elements,
d) A separate counter variable, C
In C++, which of the following statements accurately describes a characteristic of multidimensional arrays?
a) Multidimensional arrays must have the same data type for all elements,
b) The size of each dimension in a multidimensional array must be known at compile time,
c) Multidimensional arrays can have different sizes for each dimension,
d) Accessing elements in a multidimensional array requires nested loops, A
